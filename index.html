           1. In Japan, origami has inspired a lot of art, fashion, food, and even architecture! If you visit, try to find all the buildings 
            based on origami style. Hint: thereâ€™s a lot.

             2.No scissors allowed! Traditional origami uses a
             piece of paper in the shape of a square.

             invented wet-folding, and developed a method of diagramming origami instructions.
